## Salient Features

+  **Compact and Crisp** : The comments, the sidebar, the links posts and all the pages (wiki, search, related pages, submit page and all) are done in a way to avoid nested boxes, borders are removed (free world) and distinctions are handled without compromising the reddit defaults.

    * Nested comments (no css, no RES) http://i.imgur.com/5CPWWTJ.png

+  **Readability improvements** : Minimal borders, non-intrusive breaks and subtle differentiation with backgrounds to give a nice reading experience.

    * Posts in compact mode http://i.imgur.com/Cw4YIL4.png

+  **Context based styling** : The buttons change colors based on context. The "Reply" button on comments is more prominent to make replying to a comment more obvious (rather than hiding the submit link/text buttons)

    The "Submit" buttons on hot page are more prominent than on the rest pf pages. The "Create" button gets its own appropriate place in the footer without calling attention away from sidebar content.

    The expando buttons for the self-text posts, and RES added ones for images and videos are treated to be compact and in-line with the text.

+  **100% text-only** theme, no images required for the standard theme. Even the voting arrows and expando buttons are manageable for color changes without having to  depend on images.

+  **Modular CSS** for controlled and easy to manage changes with opt-in modules (custom css code) and images as needed. There are no images added by the theme, only the images that would be needed as per the subreddit customization.

    Theme [Usage](/r/mindashq/wiki/usage), and [developer help](/r/mindashq/wiki/mindashqcss) is available in the [wiki]

+  **Fully [RES compatible](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/)** (top bar, never ending reddit, night-mode full support, fixed header, custom buttons on links/posts/comments, RES commentBoxes, RES pinned headers et al).

+  Works with [Reddit Companion for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-companion/algjnflpgoopkdijmkalfcifomdhmcbe)

+ In built **[Vibgyor Flairs](/r/mindashq/wiki/flairs)**

+ **Full Mod support** including /r/toolbox Moderator tools and spam, and reported links highlighting via the stylish sheet available at http://userstyles.org/styles/91109/mindashq-for-reddit 

    * Moderator messages as viewed normally, that is without the Moderator toolbox and without the Mindashq theme looks like http://i.imgur.com/d6AmsMv.png.

    * When the same is seen with Moderator toolbox and Mindashq theme, the view gets enhanced as seen at http://i.imgur.com/hoMVW2s.png.


+  **Distinct header and footer** : A light and roomy top area, and a matching footer to go with it. The local subreddit name is seen very prominent in header for easy identification and is super intuitive for clicking. The header handles all sizes of images and logos, and keeps them true-to-reddit format (header logo links to reddit.com homepage) and looks sleek without compromising the space. The subreddit can include a custom-image, or leave the name as it is, it updates with the reddit wide custom header images, and looks not a bit out of place.


Mindashq [is also available as an stylish extension here](http://userstyles.org/styles/91109/mindashq-for-reddit) to make sure that the administrator areas of subreddit also look proper.

(The stylish extension is set so that the nicely designed subreddits are not affected, and all modmail, inboxes, settings etc areas get the clean and crisp Mindashq theme.)
